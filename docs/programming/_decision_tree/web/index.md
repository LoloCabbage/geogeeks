# Web programming languages

You've chosen a web programming language!

Projects that run on the web are usually divided in two separate sections. The **frontend** and the **backend**. Very simply said, the frontend runs in your browser, the backend runs on a server somewhere else. You'll learn more about this in GEO1007.

## Frontend languages:
Basically, frontend is always done using :simple-javascript: **JavaScript** (or its stricter sibling :simple-typescript: **TypeScript**). Sometimes a framework is used in combination with these languages.

#### Framework examples
- React 
- Angular
- Vue.js
- Svelte
- Preact

- Node.js
- Python (django or flask)

#### Optionally:
- Go

- Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
- Java (Spring boot)
