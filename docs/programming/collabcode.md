# How to code collaboratively?
<span class="tag beginner-tag">⭐️ Beginner</span>

In Geomatics, you'll do a lot of coding, and in a lot of assignments, you'll do this as a team. On this page you'll find a list of the different methods for collaborating and our recommendations. Underneath, you'll find a full list of the pros and cons of each method.

- **Meeting up and writing everything together on the same computer**: Recommended for helping each other, and for starting new projects. Can be used in combination with a version control system (see below).
- **Sending each other snippets of code**: Only recommended for helping each other if meeting up is not possible. Not recommended for projects.
- **Each person works on their own file and at the end you combine them**: Not recommended without also using a version control system.
- **Using realtime code collaboration tools (like Google Docs but for coding)**:  Not recommended without also using a version control system.
- **Using a version control system like git**: Highly recommended to learn and start using as early as possible, even for small projects.
