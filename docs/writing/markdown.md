# Markdown

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a simple and easy-to-read language for formatting plain text.

It is widely used to write documentation and research papers (eg see [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)), GitHub uses it as the default for README files, and many websites are written in Markdown (before being automatically converted to HTML).

The geogeeks website is written in Markdown, see [the source of this page](https://github.com/tudelft3d/geogeeks/edit/main/docs/writing/markdown.md)!


## Getting started

!!! external-link "GitHub's Markdown quickstart"
    [Learn Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) by making a README file for your GitHub profile


## Markdown: basic + extended versions

The [original Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is rather limited, but it has been extended by several to add more complex features (like tables and code-blocks).
Watch out, it's a bit of the far-west out there: some processors might not be able to parse your flavour of Markdown correctly!?

!!! external-link "GitHub Flavoured Markdown"
    GitHub offers an useful overview of the features they added for their extended version called "[GitHub Flavoured Markdown (GFM)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting)".
