!!! tip "Tip #1: Paste a DOI"

    With BibDesk (and probably others) you can simply copy the [DOI](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/what-is-a-doi/) and a new entry nicely formatted will be created (might need minimal manual work).

!!! tip "Tip #2: Use www.doi2bib.org"

    You could alternatively use [www.doi2bib.org](https://www.doi2bib.org) to obtain nicely formatted BibTeX entries.

!!! tip "Tip #3: Use ChatGPT"

    ChatGPT can also take the text of a reference in a PDF and BibTeX format it, see a simple example:
