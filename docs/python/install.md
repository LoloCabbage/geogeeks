=== ":simple-apple: MacOS"
    Python (v3.9+) is already installed in a new Mac.

    However, if you want to install several version, delete some if things go bad, manage your [virtual environments](/python/venv/) we recommend you use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv):

      - `brew install pyenv`
      - `pyenv install 3.11.0` to install Python v3.11.0
