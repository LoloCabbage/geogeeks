# Git, GitHub, or GitLab?

The [TUDelft has its own Git server](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl) (a GitLab server), staff can create repositories, but at the moment students cannot :crying_cat_face:.
Also, the repositories, even if created by staff, are *not* open to the outside world and thus we do not recommend using TUDelft's GitLab.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is free to use for personal use, even for private repository.
This is the preferred option.
